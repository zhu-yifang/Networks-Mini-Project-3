 Bart vs.
Australia Go, toothpaste.
Go! Move your pasty, white butt! Come on, shampoo! You can do it! I won your stupid bathroom-products race! No fair.
You only won because you had the inside track.
If the water had spun the other way It never spins the other way.
In the Northern Hemisphere water always drains counter-clockwise.
It's called the Coriolis effect.
No way.
Water doesn't obey your rules.
It goes where it wants.
Like me, babe.
Yes, Bart.
Why don't you try it and see.
I know I've seen it go the other way.
Ah, faithful toilet.
You'll prove me right.
I'm singing in the show Hot! Cold! Hot! Cold! Hot! Who's doing that? Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart, use the plunger.
Bart, water will only go the other way in the Southern Hemisphere.
What the hell is the Southern Hemisphere? Haven't you ever looked at your globe? See? The Southern Hemisphere is made up of everything below the equa This line.
So down there in, say, Argentina or Rand McNally, all their water runs backwards? In fact, in Rand McNally, they wear hats on their feet and hamburgers eat people.
- Cool.
Hello, Southern Hemisphere? Which way does the water go in your toilet? Just a minute, I'll check.
Nuts.
Please to repeat again, and I will translating for the el presidente.
Which way does the water turn in your toilet? I can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere.
- Nuisance phone.
Bart, you can't actually call these places.
Don't you know how expensive international calls are? Hello, operator, I'd like to make a collect call to Australia.
This is the operator.
Will you accept a collect call from? Yes, this is Dr.
Bart Simpson of the International Drainage Commission.
- It's an emergency.
- Lf it's an emergency We understand drains in your area have malfunctioned sucking in people and whatnot.
- Willikers! That's awful! Indeed.
We need you to check your sinks and toilets and tell us which way the water is going.
And please stand clear! The fixtures, they're all draining clockwise, sir.
She was right.
Stupid Lisa, science queen.
Well, why don't you just check your neighbors' drains.
I'll hold.
Hey, Bart, the bakery caught fire and all of downtown smells like cookies.
Want to go smell? Yes.
Yes, I do.
Hello, sir? Sir? I've returned from the Quilamaguery's place.
They're draining clockwise too.
Draining? I don't care about that anymore.
Are we in any dang "Burkina Faso"? "Disputed Zone"? Who called all these weird places? Quiet, it might be you.
I can 't remember.
- No, I'm gonna ask Marge.
- No! No! Why embarrass us both? Just write a check and I'll release some more endorphins.
Nine hundred dollary-doos?! Tobias! Did you accept a six-hour collect call from the States? It was an emergency call from the International Drainage Commission in Springfield.
Oh, my God! There
